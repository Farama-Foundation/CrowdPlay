## Customizing CrowdPlay

We have tried to strike a balance between making common use cases easily configurable and having standard configuration options cover a wide range of possible scenarios. In practice this means that many common options (e.g. RL environments to stream) are set in dedicated configuration files, while other less commonly changed things (e.g. UI elements) would need to be modified directly in Python or React code.
