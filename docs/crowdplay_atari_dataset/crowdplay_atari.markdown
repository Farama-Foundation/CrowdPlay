## The CrowdPlay Atari Dataset

The CrowdPlay Atari dataset is a collection of over 300 hours of human Atari 2600 demonstrations. In addition to vanilla gameplay, it includes substantial amounts of multiagent data, including human-human and human-AI data, as well as multimodal behavioral data, where participants were asked to follow a specific behavior in the game.
